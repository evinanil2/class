    <p class="text-muted">While most might think that Prithvi Theatre only hosts plays and that you can't visit it for anything else, let us take this opportunity to prove you wrong and introduce you to Prithvi Cafe situated right outside in the same compound. We can't begin to tell you how beautiful Prithvi Cafe is. You probably already have it all figured out. But we cannot stop ourselves from feeling overwhelmed every time we visit this dreamy place. Prithvi cafe and theatre is a place where the artists are celebrated, apart from serving some delicious food, kadak cutting chai and its famous Irish coffee

      If you're wondering what to gorge on, we're giving you a plethora of options because choosing just one was difficult for us too.
      
      Must-Try:  Suleimani Chai (which is also Gulzar's favorite),  Chilli Cheese Toast, Kheema Pav, Hummus bowls, Rajma Chawal, Mixed Parathas. If sugar rush has taken over your system, call for an Excessive Chocolate Waffle, Apple Cinnamon Muffin, and the Blueberry croissant. However, if you're just in the mood to have conversations with buddies or colleagues and keep it light., order for a Puff and a Cutting Chai, and weave stories over it.
      
      P.S: There's also a bookstore for you to grab some Gulzar with chai maybe! 
      
      Note: The Cafe is currently open only by prior booking. So do call ahead before visiting as they are taking limited bookings to prevent</p>
